# Marcus Sync

**Reminders to Markdown for macOS**

Marcus Sync lives in your menu bar and syncs Apple Reminders to any Markdown file — perfect for Obsidian, Logseq, or any text-based productivity system.

## How It Works

1. Pick a Reminder list and a Markdown file
2. Marcus syncs your tasks automatically on a schedule (or manually)
3. Tasks appear in your chosen format, ready to use

## Features

- **Menu bar app** — no dock icon, always accessible
- **Auto-sync** on configurable intervals (1 min to 2 hours)
- **One-way additive sync** — never deletes your manual edits
- **Insert under header** — place tasks under a specific heading in your file
- **Three output formats** — Emoji, Dataview, and Kanban
- **No internet** — everything stays on your Mac

## Output Formats

### Emoji (Obsidian Tasks)
```markdown
- [ ] Buy milk 📅 2026-03-15 🔼
- [x] Call dentist ✅ 2026-03-10
```

### Dataview
```markdown
- [ ] Buy milk [due:: 2026-03-15] [priority:: high]
- [x] Call dentist [due:: 2026-03-10] [completed:: 2026-03-10]
```

### Kanban
Column-based layout compatible with the Obsidian Kanban plugin.

## Requirements

- macOS 13 (Ventura) or later
- Reminders permission (requested on first launch)

## Privacy

Marcus only reads your selected Reminder list and writes to your chosen file. No data leaves your Mac. No accounts, no cloud, no telemetry.
